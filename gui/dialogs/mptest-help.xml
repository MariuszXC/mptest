    === General Description ===

	This is a heavily stripped-down model. It has no FDM, does not fly, etc.
	Its main purpose is to help in testing long range visibility of aircraft lights.
	
	Each press of a 'Backspace' key will place in view a set of three copies of this model.
	These copies are arranged in an arc, and placed in front of the viewer.
	Models placed on center line of view are placed turned directly towards the viewer, with a slight nose down attitude.
	Models placed to the sides of line of view have an additional twist and roll applied.

	The distance between viewer and sets increments with each new placed set and is equal to the multiple of
	/mptest/dst-offset-m and /mptest/counter property values.

	The altitude difference of each new set is calculated as (/mptest/counter)^2 * /mptest/alt-offset-m 

	Finally, the angle between center and side lines of view is controlled by /mptest/hdg-offset-deg

	To keep the impact of the model as low as possible, strobe lights are not animated. This may change if it turns to be useful.
